# countingCoins

## Summary
This project utilized javascript in one of our first projects with the language.  We had to create an input box for our input amount and it needed to output how many quarters, nickels, pennies and dimes were needed to equal the inputed amount.

## Setup


Requirements

Write a program that will convert a dollar amount to the number of coins that make up the amount. Use the common American coins of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
